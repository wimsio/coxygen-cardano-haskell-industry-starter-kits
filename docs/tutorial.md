Cardano needs high-quality, open templates for Real-World Assets (RWAs). These templates reduce time-to-market, lower onboarding friction, and encode best practices for developers, startups, and enterprises.

Open-source RWA starter templates for Cardano do not exist today. While other ecosystems such as WordPress, Ethereum, and Solana demonstrate the value of templates for rapid development, Cardano currently lacks a public, reusable library that can kickstart RWA projects. This program will deliver 8–10 production-grade templates, covering areas such as real estate, supply chain, healthcare, energy, transport, education, and more, and these will be built with university partners across multiple countries.

The deliverable will be a working set of 8–10 RWA templates deployed on preprod, including UI demos, validators (Plutus/Helios), oracle and emulator integrations, and complete documentation. The initial MVP will leverage the Cardano Property Solutions codebase and then expand it to support additional industries.

Project success will be demonstrated through on-chain deployments of the industry templates on preprod, open MIT-licensed repositories, adoption by student teams and startups, and measurable testnet transactions across multiple sectors, supported by public dashboards and workshops. Coxygen Global currently has 350+ tertiary students, including EBU Plutus/Haskell participants, who are ready to take part in hackathons.

Bidders must build fully working starter kits of professional grade that include documentation consisting of a specification with a customer, a design document, a user manual, and source code hosted on GitHub. Delivery must follow the process of forking the GitHub repository for this project and submitting work through a pull request. Each starter kit must include on-chain development (Haskell), off-chain components that are not CLI-based, a front-end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a backend server-side implementation using the free hosting provided by Tobb Technologies, which supports options such as PHP, Node.js, MySQL, and Python. The work must not be simple automated AI-generated shallow scripts, because these templates will be commercialized and must be first-grade applications that utilize Cardano technologies. All code must include quality unit tests.

This project targets all tertiary Plutus students at Coxygen Global. To broaden incentives and maximize productive participation, all outcomes will be lowered to 20 billable hours at a rate per hour of 8 ADA. Preference will be given to EBU Plutus certified graduates, because their fees were paid for and they need to give back something to Cardano open source.
